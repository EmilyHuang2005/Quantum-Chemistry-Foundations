## In brief

**Content**: A step-by-step introduction to quantum chemistry concepts and writing scientific software.
**Target audience**: Students interested in learning more about quantum chemistry.
**Prerequisites**: Basic Python knowledge and some exposure to quantum mechanics or physical chemistry.
**Author**: Francesco A. Evangelista

## Description

**Quantum Chemistry Foundations** is a series of tutorials that explore some of the most important ideas of quantum chemistry.
In these tutorials, you will learn about quantum chemistry from a computational perspective, which I think is a very effective complement to a detailed study of each method's formal aspects.

These tutorials assume some basic knowledge of quantum mechanics and programming in Python. By coding using Jupyter notebooks, you should only need minimal setup to follow and modify the code.

## Tutorials

The following is a list of sections that form the **Quantum Chemistry Foundations** series.

- [01 - An introduction to scientific python](01-Scientific%20Computing/01-Scientific%20Computing.ipynb). A quick introduction to NumPy and other useful tools for scientific computing. This can be skipped if you are already familiar with NumPy.
- [02 - HÃ¼ckel theory](02-HÃ¼ckel%20Theory/02-HÃ¼ckel%20Theory.ipynb) (ðŸš§ under construction ðŸš§).

More tutorials and updates are on the way!
